Overview:

This repository houses a comprehensive Restaurant Management System designed to streamline and enhance the operational efficiency of restaurants. It encompasses a robust backend built with Java, a user-friendly interface developed in Java Swing, and a meticulously structured MySQL database.

Features:

- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Includes a detailed ERD that outlines all entities involved in the system, their relationships, and 
  associative entities to manage many-to-many relationships.

- Database Schema: Utilizes DDL and DML commands for creating and populating tables with sample data. It also defines constraints and data types 
  to ensure data integrity.

- Advanced Database Operations: Implements views for simplified data analytics, functions for reusability, triggers for automated data 
  operations, and stored procedures for encapsulating business logic.
 
- Java Integration: The backend logic is coded in Java, with database interactions managed via JDBC. This setup ensures a seamless flow between 
  the UI and the database.

- Java Swing UI: The user interface, developed in Java Swing, offers an intuitive experience for users to interact with the system, making 
  operations like order management, inventory control, and customer service more efficient.
 
- Tableau Visualization: Key to our analytics, we've leveraged Tableau to visualize the data. This integration provides insightful dashboards 
  that illustrate business metrics, aiding in decision-making and strategic planning. Visualizations cover various aspects, including sales 
  trends, customer preferences, and inventory levels, making complex data comprehensible at a glance.

Business Problem Analysis:

The documentation section addresses the challenges faced by traditional restaurant management systems, such as inefficiencies and the lack of actionable insights. It further details how this system, with its database tool and Tableau visualizations, offers solutions to overcome these challenges, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

Contribution:

This project is a testament to the application of SQL, Java, and data visualization in solving real-world business problems. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in database systems, application development, or analytics in the hospitality sector.
